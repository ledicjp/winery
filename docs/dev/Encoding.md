# Encoding of folder names, namespaces, and ids in Winery

**Outdated** Although the information about double-encoding is correct, the UI has been re-implemented using Angular, which introduces an additional layer of URLs. 

## Example to understand double encoding of URIs in Winery

In file systems, characters `/` and `:` are not allowed [source](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31976060/873282).
The [design decision](../adr/0002-filesystem-folder-structure-using-type-namespace-id-structure) is that all files (node types, imports in CSARs, ...) are stored and structured using directories with human readable names.
Therefore, the namespace URI must be used in a encoded form, otherwise the name would not be valid (`http://www...`). 
An example for such a directory name is `http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2001%2FXMLSchema`.
Since (1) namespaces are URIs and (2) [percent-encoded](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.1) URIs form valid directory names, URL encoding is used.

For a better understanding we distinguish two cases: 

(1) calling a URL and 
(2) linking to the location of an tosca import in a tosca XML file contained in the CSAR.

### First case: Calling a URL

When using the Winery UI to show a Node Type the following URL is used by the browser: http://localhost:8080/winery/nodetypes/http%253A%252F%252Fopentosca.org%252Fnodetypes/Java8/
The convention for URLs in the winery are: `winery/type/namespace/id` (see [DevGuide](./#url-structure)).

 - winery:    `http://localhost:8080/winery/`
 - type:      `nodetypes`
 - namespace: `http%253A%252F%252Fopentosca.org%252Fnodetypes`
 - id:        `Java8`

We have a closer look to the namespace part `http%253A%252F%252Fopentosca.org%252Fnodetypes`:
The '/' and ':' of the URI are double [percent-encoded](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.1), i.e.,
`:` is encoded --> `%3A` is encoded --> `%253A` (`%` is encoded --> `%25`).

If no double encoding whould be used http://localhost:8080/winery/nodetypes/http%3A%2F%2Fopentosca.org%252Fnodetypes/Java8/ whould be the used URL.
Web servers such as
Apache Tomcat [[1](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14600740/873282), [2](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41559969/873282)],
Apache [[3](https://stackoverflow.com/a/9933890/873282),[4](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3235361/873282)],
nginx [[5](https://stackoverflow.com/a/37584637/873282)], and
JBoss [[6](https://stackoverflow.com/a/5628325/873282)]
forbit this due to security issues. See

- https://stackoverflow.com/a/28113090/873282

Note that `%2F` and `/` are not the same in an URI: See Example 2 in [W3C's URI recommendations](https://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/4_URI_Recommentations.html).

 
### Second Case: Encoding of directory names

As already mentioned, URLs used in directory names must be encoded.
In XML files the `location` of an `tosca:import` is, for instance given as: `../imports/http%253A%252F%252Fwww.w3.org%252F2001%252FXMLSchema/http%253A%252F%252Fopentosca.org%252Fproperties/TopicProperties/TopicProperties.xsd`, which represents the path of the file.
The attribute `location` is of type anyURI, i.e., this part [has to be decoded](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.4).
If only single encouding is used like `../imports/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org...` the decoding whould lead to `../imports/http://www.w3.org...`, which is not a valid URI and also not a valid file name.
Summary: Because the namespace is part of the used URIs and the ns itself is a URI too this double encoding is required.
