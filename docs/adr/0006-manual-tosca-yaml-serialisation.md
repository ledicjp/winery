# TOSCA YAML serialization deserialization using snakeyaml

The TOSCA YAML files have to be read into a Java model (deserialized) and written from the Java model into files (serialized).

## Considered Alternatives

* Manual serialization
* [SnakeYAML](https://bitbucket.org/asomov/snakeyaml)
* [jackson-dataformat-yaml](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-yaml)

## Conclusion

* *Chosen Alternative: Manual serialization*
* SnakeYAML does not support annotations for serialization
* jackson-dataformat-yaml seems not to support annotations, such as [jackson-annotations](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-annotations)
