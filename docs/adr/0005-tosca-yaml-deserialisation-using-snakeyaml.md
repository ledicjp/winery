# TOSCA YAML deserialization using SnakeYAML

The TOSCA YAML files have to be read into a Java model (deserialized) and written from the Java model into files (serialized).

## Considered Alternatives

* [SnakeYAML](https://bitbucket.org/asomov/snakeyaml) writing into intermediate model consisting of default Java types
* SnakeYAML writing into final Java model
* Manual reading

## Conclusion

* *Chosen Alternative: SnakeYAML writing into intermediate model consisting of default Java types*

# Comparison (Optional)
  
### SnakeYAML writing into intermediate model consisting of default Java types
  
* `+` Basic YAML parsing can be done using SnakeYAML
* `+` TOSCA Java classes can be filled directly
* `-` Programming effort for conversion

### SnakeYAML writing into final Java model

* `+` Established library
* `+` Less error prone 
* `-` SnakeYAML has to be adapted to be able to convert YAML into TOSCA models
* `-` SnakeYAML is not well-prepared for adaptions
* `-` SnakeYAML has issues to write into complex Java classes (which are not Java base types). E.g., List of Maps. - see <https://bitbucket.org/asomov/snakeyaml/issues/361/list-does-not-create-property-objects>
* `-` huge effort, first attempt did not result in a working converter

### Manual reading

* `+` Can write directly into Java model
* `-` Special cases of YAML have to be handled manually
* `-` Error prone
