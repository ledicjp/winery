# Eclipse Wineryâ„¢

Winery is a Web-based environment to graphically model TOSCA topologies and plans managing these topologies.
It is an Eclipse project and thus support is available through its project page <https://eclipse.org/winery>.
Winery is also part of the OpenTOSCA ecosystem where more information is available at <http://www.opentosca.org>.

**The code and the linked libraries are NOT approved by Eclipse Legal.**

Both development and user documentation is rendered at <http://eclipse.github.io/winery/>.
The source for the documentation can be found at [docs/](docs).

## Next steps
Winery currently is far from being a production ready modeling tool.
The next steps are:

* Add more usability features to the topology modeler
* Remove non-required files from components/ directory to reduce the file size of the WAR file
  * This has to be done by submitting patches to `bower.json` of the upstream libraries
* Develop a plugin-system for user-defined editors. For instance, a constraint has a type. If a type is known to Winery, it can present a specific plugin to edit the type content instead of a generic XML editor.
* Rework file storage. Currently, files are stored along with their definitions. A new storage should store all files in one place and use an SHA1 id to uniquely identify the file. Then, it does not make any difference if storing a WAR, an XSD, or an WSDL.
* Add a real DAO layer to enable querying the available TOSCA contents using SQL or similar query language

Currently, `.jsp` files package HTML and JS.
We plan to use frameworks such as [TerrificJS] to provide a better modularity.
This follows Nicholas Zakas' "[Scalable JavaScript Application Architecture]".

## Known issues

* XSD Type declarations are not directly supported
** Declared types are converted to imports during a CSAR Import
** Editing of XSDs is not possible
* **The XSD of OASIS TOSCA v1.0 has been modified** - see https://github.com/eclipse/winery/issues/71
** An Implementation Artifact may carry a `name` attribute
** The contents of properties of Boundary Definitions are processed in `lax` mode

#### Libraries

* Do NOT update to jQuery 2.1.0.
  When using with firefox, line 5571 in jquery.js fails: `divStyle is null`.
  That means `window.getComputedStyle( div, null );` returned `null`, too.
* Do NOT update to jsPlumb 1.5.5.
  The new connection type determination does not play well together with Winery's usage of jsPlumb. See [jsPlumb#165].
